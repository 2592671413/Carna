/** \brief
  * Represents \em "components" that are \em aggregated by \ref Geometry instances.
  * Instances of this class do manage the lifetimes of OpenGL objects that reside in video memory.
  *
  * The management of their lifetimes require two basic operations, namely \em uploading content
  * from system to video memory and \em deleting them from video memory at a later point. Both
  * of these operations must be implemented by an instance of \ref VideoResourceManager, that
  * is taken possession of by each instance of this class.
  *
  * This class uses a greedy strategy for the management: It orders the upload the moment
  * \ref acquireVideoResource "it is first told that the video resources are required" and it
  * deletes them as soon as \ref releaseVideoResource "it is told that they are no longer required".
