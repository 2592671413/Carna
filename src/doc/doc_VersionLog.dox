  *
  * This page gives you an overview over the recent API changes.

  * \section VersioningPolicies Versioning Policies
  *
  *   - The *major version number* names the overall API version. It is incremented
  *     on wide-ranged API changes. There is absolutely no downward compatibility
  *     guaranteed: The compatibility of the API is usually broken when this version
  *     number is incremented.
  *   - The *minor version number* tells the *"local"* API version. It is incremeted
  *     on API changes that do break downward compatibility, but only locally, s.t.
  *     only a few tweaks are neccessary - if any - in order to upgrade.
  *   - The *patch version number* is incremeted on such changes that neither of the
  *     two prior rules apply to: Full downward compatibility is guaranteed, thus one
  *     should always try to use the most recent patch version.

  * \subsection v_3_0_1 API Version 3.0.1
  *
  *   - Moved `%helpers::VolumeGridHelper::DEFAULT_MAX_SEGMENT_BYTESIZE` to
  *     `%helpers::VolumeGridHelperBase::DEFAULT_MAX_SEGMENT_BYTESIZE`.
  *   - Moved `%helpers::VolumeGridHelper::nativeResolution` to
  *     `%helpers::VolumeGridHelperBase::nativeResolution`.
  *   - Fixed partitioning bug in `%helpers::VolumeGridHelper` that caused odd
  *     texture sizes in some cases.
  *   - Fixed bug in \ref presets::VolumeRenderingStage that caused crashes when
  *     textures had no corresponding samplers, i.e. they were unused.
